# Tool Wear Simulation and Maintenance Analysis

This project simulates tool wear in machining operations based on key parameters like feed rate, spindle speed, and depth of cut. It identifies maintenance thresholds and visualizes insights to optimize operations.

## Features
- Simulates tool wear using a simple mathematical model.
- Triggers maintenance when wear exceeds a specified threshold.
- Visualizes tool wear trends and parameter impacts.
- Saves updated datasets and visualizations for analysis.

## Installation
1. Clone this repository:
   ```bash
   git clone https://github.com/your-username/ToolWearSimulation.git
   cd ToolWearSimulation
